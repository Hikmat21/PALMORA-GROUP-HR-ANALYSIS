# PALMORA-GROUP-HR-ANALYSIS
Analyze company data and generate insight the organization needs to address gender-related issues. 

## Steps:

- Cleaning of Data

- Assigning generic gender for employees with missing or undisclossed gender represented with unknown.

- Employee with no salary is filter

- Rows with null department was removed. This is done to ensure only active employee with valid department information.

- Stacked column was used for the Gender Distribution by Region and Department.

- A Donut chart was used to visualize the performance rating by Gender.

## 1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments.

## 3. Salary Structure Analysis & Gender Pay Gap

### Average Salary by Gender 

![Avg  salary by gender](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29bafef5-dd50-47eb-92e0-5105c328e598)

There is a gender pay gap, with males earning more on average than females.

### Departments & Regions with Gender Pay Gap
#### From prior groupings:

Several departments across all three regions (Abuja, Kaduna, Lagos) show higher average salaries for males than females.

This implies that management should focus on auditing and correcting pay structures in departments like Engineering, Sales, Legal, and Product Management, particularly in Lagos and Kaduna, where the gap was more frequent.

## 4. Compliance with Minimum Pay Regulation ($90,000)

### Palmoria's Compliance
The minimum salary requirement is $90,000 for manufacturing companies.

We need to identify if any employees fall below $90,000, and if so, how many.

## Salary Distribution in $10,000 Bands
We group salaries by bands:
$10,000–19,999, $20,000–29,999, ..., $100,000+

Based on the structure and expected distribution from earlier data,
