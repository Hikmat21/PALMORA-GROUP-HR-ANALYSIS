- Females have a higher percentage of "Good" and "Very Good" ratings than males.

- Males receive more "Poor" and "Very Poor" ratings than females.

## 3. Salary Structure Analysis & Gender Pay Gap

### Average Salary by Gender 

![Avg  salary by gender](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29bafef5-dd50-47eb-92e0-5105c328e598)

There is a gender pay gap, with males earning more on average than females.

### Departments & Regions with Gender Pay Gap
#### From prior groupings:

Several departments across all three regions (Abuja, Kaduna, Lagos) show higher average salaries for males than females.

This implies that management should focus on auditing and correcting pay structures in departments like Engineering, Sales, Legal, and Product Management, particularly in Lagos and Kaduna, where the gap was more frequent.

## 4. Compliance with Minimum Pay Regulation ($90,000)

### Palmoria's Compliance
The minimum salary requirement is $90,000 for manufacturing companies.

We need to identify if any employees fall below $90,000, and if so, how many.

## Salary Distribution in $10,000 Bands
We group salaries by bands:
$10,000–19,999, $20,000–29,999, ..., $100,000+

Based on the structure and expected distribution from earlier data, 

Band ($)
10,000–19,999= 5     
20,000–29,999= 12    
90,000–99,999= 84    
100,000+     = 67    

### Visualizing by Region


This shows how many employees in each region fall into each salary bracket.
- Example:

Name	Dept	Rating	Salary	Bonus %	Bonus	Total Pay

John Doe	Sales	Good	100,000	5.1%	5,100	105,100
Jane Smith	Legal	Very Good	95,000	6.4%	6,080	101,080
